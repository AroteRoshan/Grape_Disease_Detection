        <h3>Grapes Disease Detection system helps identify common grape leaf diseases such as Black Rot, Downy Mildew, and Esca using advanced AI techniques.
        When a disease is detected, this section provides more details to help you understand the issue and take corrective action.
        For example, if Black Rot is detected, the disease is caused by the fungus Guignardia bidwellii. It usually appears as dark, round spots on grape leaves,
        and over time can lead to shriveled, dried grapes. This disease spreads rapidly through fungal spores, especially in warm and humid weather conditions.
        To treat Black Rot and similar fungal infections, it is recommended to use fungicides such as Mancozeb or Chlorothalonil, following dosage guidelines provided
        by agricultural authorities. Organic alternatives like neem oil spray or baking soda solutions can also help prevent the disease in its early stages. Additional
        prevention measures include pruning affected areas, avoiding overhead irrigation, and maintaining proper spacing between plants to improve airflow.
        This system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a large dataset of grape leaf images. The model learns to recognize subtle patterns, such as 
        leaf color, shape, and spot textures, to accurately predict diseases in real-time.
        To help users learn better, visual examples of healthy and diseased leaves are also provided. These allow you to compare your own leaves with actual disease patterns. 
        For further information, links to reliable agricultural resources like the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and grape farming guides are available.
        By combining modern AI with accessible guidance, this tool empowers farmers and students to detect diseases early and take action to protect grape crops effectively.</h3>
